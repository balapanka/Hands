    <h2>Holding Splendor: Celebrating Beautiful Hands That Have Truly Lived</h2>
    <p>
        Hands sometimes speak louder than words. We touch a newborn’s tiny toes. We wipe away tears. We soothe someone’s sore muscles. We caress a head. We cook a meal. We pick flowers. For many of us, the instruments at the ends of our arms are key to our work and passion. Surgeons, dentists, pianists, gardeners, chefs, masseuses, writers—all depend on their hands to create and perform.
